      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
       <p> 
        Building a PC requires careful selection and integration of several key components:

<p>CPU (Central Processing Unit): The main processor that performs most of the computational tasks.</p>

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): Handles rendering of images, video, and animations.
Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects all components and allows communication between them.
RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary storage used by the CPU to run programs and processes.
Storage: SSDs (Solid State Drives) or HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for storing data long-term.
Power Supply Unit (PSU): Provides power to all components in the PC.
Case: Encloses and protects the components; also aids in cooling.
Cooling System: Fans or liquid cooling to maintain optimal temperatures.
For correct integration:

Ensure the CPU is compatible with the motherboard’s socket type.
The GPU should fit into the motherboard’s PCIe slot and be supported by the PSU wattage.
RAM should be compatible with the motherboard’s slots and supported frequency.
